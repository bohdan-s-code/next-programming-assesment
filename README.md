## Before start
Make sure you have all **Essential Software** installed:
- Node.js and npm(Node Package Manage) or Yarn. 
  - Download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
  - This will also install npm (Node Package Manager). You can verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. 
  - If you prefer to use Yarn, you can install it using npm: `npm install --global yarn`.
- Code Editor or IDE.
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is highly recommended due to its excellent JavaScript support and extensive features. You can download it from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - If you prefer a different editor, make sure it has basic JavaScript syntax highlighting and code formatting capabilities.
- Web Browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
